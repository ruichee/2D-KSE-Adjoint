# Adjoint_Descent_for_Invariant_Solutions
This repository includes scripts implementing the adjoint method proposed by M. Farazmand (2015). It is used to find invariant solutions of dynamical systems. In this project, we seek equilibria solutions to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation through the adjoint descent method.
This code is developed as part of an undergraduate research project.
